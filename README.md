This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project 7: Cryptocurrency quote.
This web app uses an API to fetch news depending on different categories and countries. It uses custom hooks and a css module to style some of the components.

## Available Scripts

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies required.<br />

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
